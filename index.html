		<p class="paragraph">A lotus flower may not seem like much to think about at first glance, but first impressions can be misleading. <br>While the 
		plant's symmetry and colors are surely striking, beneath the delicate exterior of a lotus lies a deeper <br> meaning nearly as old as time.</p>
		<p>First and foremost, the lotus flower has a life cycle unlike any other plant. With its roots latched in mud, <br>
		it submerges every night into river water and miraculously re-bloom the next morning, sparklingly clean. <br> As a result, this
	  has led the flower to have associations as the flower with rebirth and spiritual enlightement.</p>
    <p>I love the lotus flower because it reminds us that, <em>"beauty is possible even in the darkest of places".</em> So through <br>
		all the hardships we may face in life, we'll always conquer.</p>
